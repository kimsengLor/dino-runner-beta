## Current Feature
- Infinite Scrolling: The Camera and Dino constantly move forward, and the ground automatically loops back in front of them so the level never ends.
- Three Ground Obstacles: The game randomly spawns Boxes, Ridges, and Stones on the ground.
- Animated Flying Obstacles: The game spawns animated Birds that flap their wings and fly at two distinct heights (low and high).
- Dynamic Difficulty: As the score increases, the game gets harder by spawning up to 3 ground obstacles tightly clustered together.
